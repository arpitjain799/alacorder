        "\n",
        "**Alacorder can run on most devices. If your device can run Python 3.7 or later, it can run alacorder.**\n",
        "* To install on Windows, open Command Prompt and enter `pip install alacorder`. \n",
        "    * To start the interface, enter `python -m alacorder` or `python3 -m alacorder`.\n",
        "* On Mac, open the Terminal and enter `pip3 install alacorder` then `python3 -m alacorder`.\n",
        "    * To start the interface, enter `python3 -m alacorder` or `python -m alacorder`.\n",
        "* If pip, pip3, python, and python3 do not work from your computer, install [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution), create a virtual environment, open a terminal, and then repeat these instructions. If your copy of alacorder is corrupted, use `pip uninstall alacorder` or `pip3 uninstall alacorder` and then reinstall it. There may be a newer version.\n",

        "If you would like to visualize data without exporting to Excel or another format, create a `jupyter notebook`, and import a data visualization library like `matplotlib` to get started. The [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html) tutorials and documentation can help you get started. `jupyter` is a Python [notebook](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html) kernel you can use to create interactive tools like this notebook. It can be installed using `pip install jupyter` or `pip3 install jupyter` and launched using `jupyter notebook`. Your computer may already be equipped to view `jupyter` notebooks. \n",
