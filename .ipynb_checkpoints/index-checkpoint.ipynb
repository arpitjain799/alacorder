    "### Alacorder processes case detail PDFs into data tables suitable for research purposes. Alacorder also generates compressed text archives from the source PDFs to speed future data collection from the same set of cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Installation**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alacorder can run on most devices. If your device can run Python 3.7 or later, it can run Alacorder.**\n",
    "* To install on Windows and Mac, open Command Prompt (Terminal) and enter `pip install alacorder` or `pip3 install alacorder`. \n",
    "* On Mac, open the Terminal and enter `pip install alacorder` or `pip3 install alacorder`.\n",
    "* Install [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) to install Alacorder if the above methods do not work, or if you would like to open an interactive browser notebook equipped with Alacorder on your desktop.\n",
    "    * After installation, create a virtual environment, open a terminal, and then repeat these instructions. If your copy of Alacorder is corrupted, use `pip uninstall alacorder` or `pip3 uninstall alacorder` and then reinstall it. There may be a newer version available.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Alacorder should automatically download and install missing dependencies upon setup, but you can also install them yourself with `pip`: `pandas`, `numpy`, `PyPDF2`, `openpyxl`, `xlrd`, `xlwt`, `xarray`, `numexpr`, `bottleneck`, `jupyter`, and `click`. Recommended dependencies: `xlsxwriter`, `tabulate`, `matplotlib`.**"

It can connect to a wide variety of services to expand the capability of Alacorder data. When Alacorder data is exported to `.pkl`, it is stored as a `DataFrame` and can be imported into other python [modules](https://www.anaconda.com/open-source) and libraries with `pd.read_pickle()` like below:\n",

The pandas tutorials and documentation can help you get started. [`jupyter`](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/start/index.html) is a Python kernel you can use to create interactive tools like this notebook.
